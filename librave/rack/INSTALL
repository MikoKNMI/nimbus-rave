RACK

'RACK' is a C++ based program for radar data processing.


PREREQUISITES

The package has been developed with Eclipse IDE, which uses cmake/gmake 
facility in managing file indepencies. In this installation package, the
involved makefile, *.d, and *.mk files are stored in make.zip. 

At least three libraries are needed:

        Png       (libpng12.so) png image files
        Proj4     (libproj.so)  projections  
	Drain     (libdrain.a)  utilities developed at FMI 

Optionally, if support for several image file formats is desired:

        Magick++  (libMagick++.so)

In some Debian based Linuces the general libraries can be installed with:

  sudo apt-get install libpng12-0  libproj libmagick++1


DOWNLOADING RACK AND DRAIN

   git clone gitosis@git.baltrad.eu:drain.git
   git clone gitosis@git.baltrad.eu:rack.git

COMPILATION

Issue 'make' without arguments for help. 

To compile the code at command line, issue 

  make release

The command unzips make.zip to Release/ directory and calls 'make all'
there. The default version has image file I/O support for PNG only.
In order to get the support for many other image formats, compile with

  make with_magick=yes release

One can also set hdfroot, projroot and drainroot, for example:

  make ... hdfroot=/usr/lib projroot=/opt drainroot=/opt release

where $drainroot is the location of drain library, finding the header
files in $drainroot/include/drain/*.h and the library file in 
$drainroot/lib/libdrain.a; respectively for  $hdfroot and $projroot.

Respectively, one may also modify compiler and linker flags:

  make  ... CCFLAGS=<flags> LDFLAGS=<flags>  release

In that case, user must explicitly set Magick++ switches, if the library is 
used. Execute 'Magick++-config' and see Makefile for details.


INSTALLATION

  sudo make prefix=$DIR install


The binary will be copied to $DIR/bin . You will probably have to modify
environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH, for example:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/lib
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/bin



In problems:

It is sometimes wise to clean these from your directories;
try "make clean-all"



DOCUMENTATION

A PDF manual may be shipped with this file, or can be generated with

  make manual

which generates both HTML and PDF versions.
