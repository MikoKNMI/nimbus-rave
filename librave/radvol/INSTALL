Radvol-QC is integrated into a working RAVE installation, so following RAVE's 
installation instructions will also build RADVOL.

The Python wrappers to RADVOL's functionality are found in RAVE's "modules"
directory. Similarly, the toolbox's framework for unit testing is used to
test this functionality through the Python wrappers. However, RADVOL's own 
testing functionality using the CUnit package can be run here with 

radvol$ make test

RADVOL's headers and library will be installed in $RAVEROOT/include and
$RAVEROOT/lib respectively. There should be no need to update your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
