Before installing RAVE, a number of modules/software packages have to be
installed.
- (Gnu) C and C++ compilers
- ZLIB (optional)
- Tcl and Tk 8.5.5
- Python 2.6 final or 2.7.x, but not 3.x
- Numeric Python (NumPy) 1.2.1 or higher
- Python Imaging Library 1.1.6 or higher
- HDF5 1.8.5-patch1 or higher
- PycURL 7.19+ (and underlying cURL)
- PROJ.4 version 4.7.0 or higher
All of these packages are available on any credible Linux distribution,
and can be managed through package managers like yum, apt-get, and dpkg.

You also need the following package that you probably won't find 
bundled with your Linux.
- HLHDF/PyHL 0.7+

We also have optional support for C-based handling 
of cartographic projection and geographic area registries. 
If you want these, you will need
- expat 2.0.1
which is also on most Linuces.

If you use pre-compiled packages that come along with your Linux
distribution, don't forget to install the respective "devel" 
package containing headers and libraries too.

The README file contains more details about these packages.

If these packages have been installed and set up correctly, 
ensuring that numpy and _pyhl can be found when importing from Python,
then you can perform the following.
$ python
>>> import numpy
>>> import _pyhl

Some minor configuration changes can be made.
To activate memory debugging of RAVE: CFLAGS=-DRAVE_MEMORY_DEBUG
This is recommended for a development system.

A few environment variables are required to find RAVE dependencies. 
1. RAVE installation directory (default is /opt/rave):
$ export RAVEROOT=<install dir>

2. NumPy headers, e.g. for a Python distribution installed under /usr/local:
$ export NUMPYDIR=/usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy

3. HL-HDF installation, e.g. normal place for BALTRAD:
$ export HLDIR=/opt/baltrad/hlhdf

4. PROJ.4 projections library
$ PROJ4ROOT=/my/path
  or specify include and lib directories separately
$ export PROJ4INC=/my/path/include
$ export PROJ4LIB=/my/path/lib

5. (OPTIONAL) expat
The default behaviour is to build without expat support. However, management 
of projection and area registries requires expat, so it's probably a good
idea to install it. The environment  variable EXPATARG can be used to modify 
the arguments passed to the configure scripts and can be one of
$ export EXPATARG=<inc>,<lib>
or
$ export EXPATARG=<expatroot>
or
$ export EXPATARG=yes
or
$ export EXPATARG=no

If you are going to use the XML-RPC server, you can configure a number of
variables prior to installing RAVE, also using environment variables:
$ export PGF_HOST=myhost.mydomain  # an IP number works too, default=localhost
$ export PGF_PORT=8085             # default number
The host:port for the DEX single point-of-entry:
$ export DEX_SPOE=host:port        # default is localhost:8084
WMO originating center number:
$ export CENTER_ID=82              # Sweden is 82. Use your country's!
If you need to change back to a default value, set the environment variable
to the default and then run 'make install' again. You don't have to rebuild.

To modify memory debugging configuration options, specify the parameters before
running make, for example:
$ CFLAGS=-DRAVE_MEMORY_DEBUG RAVEROOT=/opt/testbuilds/rave make

It is possible to install the software at the same time it is built, but
unless you are certain that everything will go well, first build, then
test, and then finally install the software.
$ make
$ make test
$ make install

or, if you are brave, just

$ make install

When RAVE is installed, you should add $RAVEROOT/bin to your $PATH and 
$RAVEROOT/lib to your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
You must be able to write one file to your Python's site-packages 
directory! RAVE won't be installed there, but a file pointing to RAVE will be.
This should happen automatically when RAVE is installed. However, if you are 
using a system-wide Python installation without write privileges to the 
site-packages directory, then you must set up a user site-packages 
directory and place the rave.pth file there manually. The contents of the 
rave.pth file are just one line, containing the complete path to your RAVE 
installation's Lib directory, e.g. /opt/rave/Lib
Instructions for this are found at http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0370/ 

Building the documentation system requires that doxygen is installed. If
you have doxygen, then:

$ make doc

The documentation will be generated to ./doxygen/doxygen/html and latex
directories.
