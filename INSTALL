If these packages has been installed and setup correctly including
making sure that numpy and _pyhl can be found when importing from python.

>>> import _pyhl

It is possible to do some minor configuration changes.
Activate memory debug of rave: CFLAGS=-DRAVE_MEMORY_DEBUG

To modify these configuration options, specify the parameters before running make,
for example:

It is possible to install the software at the same time it is built but
unless you are certain that everything will go well first build, then
test and finally install the software.
%> make
%> make check
%> make install

or if you are brave

%> make install
