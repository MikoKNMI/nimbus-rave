RAVE reads and writes data to/from the HDF5 file format only.

Input HDF5 data must follow the H5rad version 1.2 information model according 
to COST 717 Working Document WDF_02_200204_1 (Michelson et al. 2003)
available at http://smhi.se/cost717/ .

Output from RAVE will attempt to follow the same information model, but in
some cases does not succeed. This is particularly evident for
superobservations which are written to plain ASCII.

Using H5rad 1.2 is a natural choice since it is being used operationally by
several weather services, and as such is the only operational use of HDF5
for weather radar data internationally at present.

Future versions of RAVE will enable reading/writing HDF5 files according to
the emerging EUMETNET OPERA standard. This information model is a much
better choice for many reasons, but it is presently still a draft and it is
not being used in practise anywhere yet.
