\section apioverview "API Overview"
Rave has been developed as a c-library that provides the necessary functions for
working with Radar data in various ways. It's base is a small framework for
manipulating objects by reference counting. It also contains some functions for
supporting memory tracking and debugging. On top of this framework, several different
objects has been created in order to support navigation and calculations of data. Most
of the apis has been developed for radar-processing but there is nothing that says that
it could not be used for other types of geographical calculations.

In order to support python, a similar python api has been developed on top of the
c-api, there are several reasons for this, but the most obvious reason is that it
is quite simple to work with python instead of c.

Before we dig down to deep, we first should take a look at the fundamentals in \ref rave_capi
