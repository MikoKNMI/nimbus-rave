Summer 2011
-----------
Flexible configuration when building - e.g. host and port
Adapt to accept and process ODIM_H5 2.1
Consolidation of projection and area registries
Runtime registration of projections and areas
Convenience functions for automatic definition of areas

From Summer 2010
----------------
Elaborate the ODIM data structures so data quality can be represented in
all polar and Cartesian datasets.

Smarter runtime management of projection and Cartesian area definitions.

Replace the ElementTree-based Python structures with the ODIM C structures.

The XMLRPC server needs some elaboration:
    - better options for bin/rave_pgf, e.g. ability to give the host:port
      on the command line
    - threading?
    - log to HTTP, maybe so baltrad-node can listen to RAVE's log
    - authentication/authorization?
    - https as an alternative to http

The migration to Python 3.0 remains just beyond the horizon...

Stay tuned.
