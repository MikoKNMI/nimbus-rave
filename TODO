The BALTRAD project will probably introduce some radical changes to how
RAVE is designed and built in future versions.

No matter what, the next version of RAVE should be built on Python 3.0 and
with HDF5 version 1.8.x. Migrating to these two components involves large
changes, many of which are backwardly incompatible.

It is too speculative to say when the next version will be ready, and what
it will contain.

Stay tuned...
